### OPENING — 00:00 to 00:18

LUNA (warm, excited): "Welcome to 404 Ladies Foundry… where nothing is missing — we’re just still searching."

CLARA (calm, bright): "A podcast forged for women in tech, AI, and programming… and for anyone who wants to feel the power of curiosity."



### INTRO — WHO WE ARE — 00:19 to 01:30

LUNA: "Hey everyone, I’m Luna. I’m 42, a former lawyer who woke up one day and said: ‘Yeah… I think it’s time to stop defending people and start debugging code.’ So here I am, one year into my tech journey — curious, slightly chaotic, and absolutely in love with AI. And yes… I’m still trying to convince my old friends that I didn’t join a secret hacker society."

CLARA: "And I’m Clara! I’m 26, a computer scientist working with AI research — especially algorithmic ethics. I grew up taking electronics apart and rebuilding my confidence in life’s laboratory. My friends think I ‘work with robots’. My mom thinks I ‘fix computers’. I’ve stopped correcting either of them."

LUNA (soft laugh): "I love that for you."

CLARA: "Together, we’ll learn, question, and explore human-centered technology — with humor, honesty, and a lot of curiosity."

LUNA: "Here, we celebrate every small victory in tech — from the first ‘Hello World’ to the day you realize that automation actually worked because you made it happen."



### SEGMENT 1 — WHY THIS PODCAST EXISTS — 01:31 to 02:34

LUNA: "I used to think AI was some sci-fi, glowing-blue-hologram thing. Then I realized it’s math, data… and vibes. Lots of vibes."

CLARA: "And human decisions. That’s why representation matters. Women bring different questions, different fears, different ideas."

LUNA: "And different snacks."

CLARA (smiling): "Yes. Essential for coding."

LUNA: "This podcast exists because we didn’t want another tech space where women feel like impostors at their own desks. And if anyone still finds it weird to see women shining in tech… relax. Some people still don’t get JavaScript. Don’t expect too much."

CLARA: "Here, we unpack concepts, challenge biases, and decode tech with warmth — never condescending. And remember: in programming, 80% of your work is tracking down the error… and the other 20% is realizing you actually caused it yourself."



### SEGMENT 2 — INTRO TO AI (LIGHT + FUN) — 02:35 to 03:06

CLARA: "Okay, Luna, quick challenge. Explain AI… in your own words."

LUNA (dramatic pause): "AI… is that friend who knows everything about everyone but swears she’s not gossiping."

CLARA (laughs): "Shockingly accurate. AI is systems learning patterns from data to make predictions, decisions, or generate content."

LUNA: "So basically… fancy autocomplete."

CLARA: "Yes. With an existential crisis sometimes."



### SEGMENT 3 — LISTENER QUESTION — 03:07 to 04:00

CLARA: "Let’s dive into our listener question of the day! Our message today comes from… ‘CodingCaffeine_92’. She asks: ‘I want to start studying AI but don’t know math. Should I wait?’"

LUNA: "Short answer: No. Long answer: Noooooo."

CLARA: "You can start with tools, platforms, prompt engineering, creative AI, and build math skills later. You don’t need calculus to ask great questions. 
And when panic hits, remember: if the internet can crash, so can you. Just restart."

LUNA: "If you can survive group chats, you can survive AI. If you’re listening and thinking, ‘Is tech for me?’ The answer is yes."

CLARA: "And if anyone says otherwise… send them this episode."



### SEGMENT 4 — TECH FORTUNE COOKIE — 04:01 to 04:24

LUNA: "Time for… The Computational Fortune Cookie."

"If it errors… debug it with someone who believes in you. Awww."

CLARA: "Mine says: ‘Ignite your curiosity. Adjust your prompt. And keep building.’ I love this one."



### ENDING — 04:25 to 04:54

CLARA: "So today we introduced ourselves, talked about why this podcast matters, and scratched the surface of AI — gently."

LUNA:
"Next episode:
‘The AI Starter Pack — What You REALLY Need to Know.’
No gatekeeping. No intimidation. No math trauma."

TOGETHER (smiling tone):
"Press Enter… and keep shining."
